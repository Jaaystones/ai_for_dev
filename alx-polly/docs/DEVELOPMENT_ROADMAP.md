## 🛠️ **EDGE CASES & SOLUTIONS**

### 1. **Preventing Duplicate Votes**

**Problem**: Users voting multiple times in the same poll

**Solutions Implemented**:

```sql
-- Database constraints
UNIQUE(poll_id, user_id),     -- Authenticated users
UNIQUE(poll_id, ip_address)   -- Anonymous users
```

**API Logic**:

```typescript
// Check for existing vote before allowing new one
const existingVote = await supabase
  .from("votes")
  .select("id")
  .eq("poll_id", pollId)
  .eq(user ? "user_id" : "ip_address", user?.id || clientIP)
  .single();

if (existingVote && !poll.allow_multiple_votes) {
  throw new Error("Already voted");
}
```

**Additional Measures**:

- Browser fingerprinting for enhanced detection
- Rate limiting per IP address
- Cookie-based tracking for anonymous users
- Admin tools to detect suspicious voting patterns

### 2. **QR Code Integration in Poll Creation**

**Implementation Flow**:

```typescript
// 1. Create poll in database
const poll = await createPoll(pollData);

// 2. Generate QR code with poll URL
const qrCodeUrl = await generateQRCode(
  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/polls/${poll.id}`
);

// 3. Update poll with QR code URL
await updatePoll(poll.id, { qr_code_url: qrCodeUrl });

// 4. Show QR code in UI immediately
return { poll: { ...poll, qr_code_url: qrCodeUrl } };
```

**QR Code Generation Options**:

- **External API**: QR Server API (simple, fast)
- **Library**: `qrcode` npm package (full control)
- **Custom**: SVG generation (lightweight)

### 3. **Sample Vote Schema Linking Users and Polls**

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.votes (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,

  -- Core relationships
  poll_id UUID REFERENCES public.polls(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  option_id UUID REFERENCES public.poll_options(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,

  -- Metadata for duplicate prevention
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  browser_fingerprint TEXT,

  -- Timestamps
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),

  -- Constraints
  UNIQUE(poll_id, user_id),           -- One vote per user per poll
  UNIQUE(poll_id, ip_address),        -- One vote per IP per poll (anonymous)

  -- Ensure at least one identifier exists
  CHECK (user_id IS NOT NULL OR ip_address IS NOT NULL)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_votes_poll_user ON public.votes(poll_id, user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_votes_poll_ip ON public.votes(poll_id, ip_address);
CREATE INDEX idx_votes_created_at ON public.votes(created_at);
```

**Query Examples**:

```sql
-- Get user's vote for specific poll
SELECT v.*, po.text as option_text
FROM votes v
JOIN poll_options po ON v.option_id = po.id
WHERE v.poll_id = $1 AND v.user_id = $2;

-- Get poll results with vote counts
SELECT po.*, COUNT(v.id) as vote_count
FROM poll_options po
LEFT JOIN votes v ON po.id = v.option_id
WHERE po.poll_id = $1
GROUP BY po.id
ORDER BY po.order_index;

-- Check if user already voted
SELECT EXISTS(
  SELECT 1 FROM votes
  WHERE poll_id = $1 AND user_id = $2
);
```
